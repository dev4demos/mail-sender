# Objective: to create an API in Laravel for sending messages to a fixed email. You can not actually send an email message, but make a service that “pretends” that it has accepted the message for sending.

## List of fields on the form:
1. message content (textarea)

## Provide:
1. field validation;
2. protection against 1 person being able to send a message an unlimited number of times;
3. storing sent messages in the database (it is enough that the project contains only migrations, the database itself is not needed).

## It will be a big plus, but not necessarily:
1. Document the API.
2. Write Unit tests.

## Put the finished work on any open repository and throw off the link (for example, github.com).

## Remember, we will be paying attention to the style / presentation of the code, the naming of your commits, etc.
